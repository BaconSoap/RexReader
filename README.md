RexReader
=========

A C# Library for reading REXPaint files

Follow [this guide](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages) to automatically install required nuget packages on build, or manually add the NUnit package/dll yourself.
You can build the RexReader project without NUnit, but the tests require it to run.
